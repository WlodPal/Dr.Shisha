    <string name="the_materials_of_the_bowl">The flavor of the tobacco, and consequently the enjoyment of the hookah, directly depends on the proper heating of the bowl and the even distribution of heat. The type, shape, material, and coating of the bowl affect how it heats up. Depending on your goals, you may need certain properties in the materials of the bowl.</string>
    <string name="strong_and_week_sides_clay_bow">Advantages:\n - Low cost.\n - High heat resistance.\n Disadvantages:\n - Potential for overheating.\n - Difficult to clean due to syrup absorption.</string>
    <string name="strong_and_week_sides_ceramic">Advantages:\n - Do not affect the flavor.\n - Easy to clean.\n - Do not retain odors.\n Disadvantages:\n - Difficult to control the heat.\n - Unglazed models are fragile. \n - More expensive than clay bowls.</string>
    <string name="clay_desc">Clay hookah bowls are timeless classics. They are quite heat-resistant, and the tobacco heats evenly in them. Compared to other materials, they are more affordable; however, without using a heat management device, they can overheat and spoil the flavor of the tobacco. Nevertheless, using additional accessories can mitigate this drawback.</string>
    <string name="ceramic_desc">In general, ceramics are clay that has been fired and covered with glaze. The additional layer prevents the syrup from being absorbed into the walls of the hookah bowl, which allows the smells from previous fillings to stop haunting you and affecting the taste of the new tobacco. This also makes it easier to clean these bowls. n\ n\ The production technology of ceramic hookah bowls not covered with glaze provides them with greater thermal conductivity, which leads to lower heat resistance. Therefore, you should not put them under cold water immediately after smoking to avoid cracks.</string>
